# php-gobetween

This is a client library for gobetween you can install it by doing

```
composer require dhope0000/php-gobetween
```

It currently implements all the end points listed in here in the documentation
[here](http://gobetween.io/documentation.html#REST-API) if a new endpoint becomes
available add an issue or I may pick it up and add it already

## Documentation
I have added some basic documentation in the docs/ folder for setting up a client
and some notes for servers

## Inspired By
This client application is inspired by [this library](https://github.com/ashleyhood/php-lxd)
